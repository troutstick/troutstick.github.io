Hi, and welcome to my blog! I'm Justin Thein, an ever-curious student currently studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
I'm also a software development officer for Berkeley's chapter of [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.berkeley.edu/),
a CS honor society.

I absolutely love writing programs in Rust, which has given me a taste for embedded development
and sleek, efficient, performant code. In fact, it was my experiences with the Rust language
that inspired me to start writing here!
In my spare time, I enjoy biking and running, and I love going down Wikipedia
rabbit holes.

Proud Linux user and [Rust evangelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab).
