It's easy to take for granted the incredible amount of information
that we have right at our fingertips. With devices such as the
personal computer and the smartphone, we have access to ludicrous
resources. In an argument over what the capital of Montana is?
Wondering how roller coasters are designed? Need to know where
there's a public bathroom nearby? Just Google it.

The amount of general knowledge that is parsed by a search engine
like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo is impossible for a human mind
to comprehend, and many of you will agree that it's become a
defining feature of life in the 21st century.
